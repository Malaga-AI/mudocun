What is the primary benefit of a longer integration time in this context?","choices":["Longer integration times allow for the detection of fainter features, such as the double-gap, with higher signal-to-noise ratios.","Longer integration times are required to resolve the individual dust rings, which are not detectable with shorter integrations.","Longer integration times reduce the impact of thermal noise, making it easier to distinguish real features from artifacts.","Both A and C are correct."],"correct_answer_idx":3},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 8 displays radial profiles of various disk properties for different planet masses, viscosities, and initial surface density profiles.
