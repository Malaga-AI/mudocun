What is the output of this process?\n\n**(A)**  A list of predefined rhetorical patterns.\n**(B)**  The identification of support and attack relations.\n**(C)**  An instantiation of the argument structure, including the selected rhetorical pattern and slot filling. \n**(D)**  A logic-based abstractive summary of the input argument.\n\n**Correct Answer:** **(C)**  An instantiation of the argument structure, including the selected rhetorical pattern and slot filling. \n\n**Explanation:** Figure 1 visually represents how the framework takes an argumentative relation as input and outputs a specific argument structure instance with the chosen pattern and filled slots. \n\n\n**Figure 2:**\n\n**Question:** What type of argumentation scheme do the rhetorical patterns in Figure 2 primarily represent?\n\n**(A)** Argument from Consequences\n**(B)** Argument from Analogy, Proposition, Quantifier, and Presupposition\n**(C)** Argument from Expert Opinion\n**(D)** Argument from Definition\n\n**Correct Answer:** **(B)** Argument from Analogy, Proposition, Quantifier, and Presupposition\n\n**Explanation:**  Figure 2 specifically illustrates patterns related to analogy, proposition, quantifier, and presupposition arguments,  distinct from the argument from consequence scheme.\n\n\n**Figure 3:**\n\n**Question:** What does the distribution of agreements in Figure 3 suggest about the initial annotation of argumentative relations (Stage 1)?\n\n**(A)** Annotators achieved near-perfect agreement on labeling relations.\n**(B)** Annotators showed considerable inconsistency, especially in labeling rebuttal and undercut relations.\n**(C)** One annotator heavily favored labeling relations as \"OTHER,\"  while the other showed a more balanced approach. \n**(D)** The Argument from Consequences pattern was the most frequently assigned pattern across all relation types. \n\n**Correct Answer:** **(C)** One annotator heavily favored labeling relations as \"OTHER,\"  while the other showed a more balanced approach.\n\n**Explanation:** Figure 3 depicts variations in annotation patterns, highlighting that one annotator predominantly used \"OTHER\" while the other utilized a broader range of patterns.\n\n\n**Figure 5:**\n\n**Question:** After the three-stage annotation process, what can be concluded about the final corpus, as shown in Figure 5?\n\n**(A)** The majority of relations are now labeled as \"Unsure\" due to unresolved disagreements. \n**(B)** The distribution of rhetorical patterns remains largely unchanged compared to the initial annotation.\n**(C)**  The final corpus shows a high level of agreement on argumentative relation annotations.\n**(D)** The \"OTHER\" category now represents the most frequent annotation for all relation types. \n\n**Correct Answer:**  **(C)**  The final corpus shows a high level of agreement on argumentative relation annotations.\n\n**Explanation:** Figure 5 represents the outcome of the three-stage process, illustrating a significant reduction in disagreements and a more consistent pattern of annotations.\n\n\n**Table 1:**\n\n**Question:** According to Table 1, what is the most frequently observed type of clue required to understand the logic behind argumentative relations?\n\n**(A)**  Causality\n**(B)**  Value Judgment\n**(C)**  World Knowledge \n**(D)** Temporal Information\n\n**Correct Answer:** **(B)** Value Judgment\n\n**Explanation:** Table 1 presents the distribution of clues needed for understanding argumentative relations. It highlights \"Value Judgment\" as the most frequently required clue type. \n"}
