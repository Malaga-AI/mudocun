What can you conclude about the typical observing strategy of SDSS?\n\n**(A)** Observations for a single target are usually spread over several nights.\n\n**(B)** Most targets require more than ten individual exposures to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n**(C)** The majority of targets are observed within a single night.\n\n**(D)** The time between subspectra is always consistent for a given target.\n\n**Correct Answer: (C)** The majority of targets are observed within a single night.\n\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n**Figure 3:** This figure depicts the radial velocity variability of the SDSS white dwarf sample, separated by mass. What is the main takeaway from the excess seen in the low mass white dwarf group (cyan line) compared to the noise curve?\n\n**(A)**  Low mass white dwarfs have a low binary fraction.\n\n**(B)** Single stars frequently evolve to become low mass white dwarfs.\n\n**(C)** Low mass white dwarfs are likely progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.\n\n**(D)** Low mass white dwarfs have a high binary fraction. \n\n**Correct Answer: (D)**  Low mass white dwarfs have a high binary fraction.\n\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n**Figure 4 (middle):** This panel illustrates the detection probability of double degenerate binaries as a function of the masses of the component stars. What is the effect of a more massive companion on the detection probability?\n\n**(A)** It decreases the detection probability. \n\n**(B)** It has no significant effect on the detection probability.\n\n**(C)** It increases the detection probability. \n\n**(D)** The effect depends on the orbital period of the binary. \n\n**Correct Answer: (C)** It increases the detection probability.\n\n\n**Question 4:**\n\n**Formula (3):** This formula represents the mass function (fm) of a binary system. What information does the mass function provide about a binary system?\n\n**(A)** The total mass of the binary system.\n\n**(B)** The luminosity ratio of the two stars in the binary.\n\n**(C)** The lower limit on the mass of the unseen companion star.\n\n**(D)** The exact masses of both stars in the binary.\n\n**Correct Answer: (C)** The lower limit on the mass of the unseen companion star. \n"}
