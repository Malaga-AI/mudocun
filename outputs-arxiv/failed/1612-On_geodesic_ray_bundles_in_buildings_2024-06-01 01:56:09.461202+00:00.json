The set of all chambers closer to x than to any chamber outside the region.\nB. The union of all minimal galleries from x to chambers in the direction of η. \nC. A tubular neighborhood of the geodesic ray from x to η.\n**D. The combinatorial sector based at x and pointing towards ξ.**\n\n**Answer: D**\n\n**Figure 2: Singular direction**\n\n**Question 2:** What is significant about the direction η in Figure 2 compared to Figure 1?\n\n**A. The direction η is singular, meaning the geodesic ray [x, η) lies within a tubular neighborhood of a wall.**\nB. The direction η is non-singular, meaning the geodesic ray [x, η) does not lie within a tubular neighborhood of any wall.\nC. Figure 2 depicts a combinatorial sector in a Euclidean building, while Figure 1 depicts a hyperbolic building.\nD. Figure 2 illustrates a building of type A1, while Figure 1 illustrates a building of type A2.\n\n**Answer: A**\n\n**Formula: Geo(x, η) := {y ∈ X(0) | y lies on some Γ∈ CGR(x, η)}**\n\n**Question 3:**  What does the formula for Geo(x, η) describe?\n\nA. The set of all chambers in the building X.\nB. The set of all chambers contained within a specific apartment. \n**C. The set of all chambers that lie on some combinatorial geodesic ray from x to η.**\nD. The set of all walls crossed by a combinatorial geodesic ray from x to η. \n\n**Answer: C**\n\n**Lemma 3.14:** Assume that the building X is hyperbolic. Then Cη is a bounded set of chambers for each η ∈ ∂X. In particular, if X is, moreover, locally finite, then Cη is finite for all η ∈ ∂X.\n\n**Question 4:**  What does Lemma 3.14 tell us about the set Cη in a hyperbolic, locally finite building?\n\nA.  Cη is always infinite.\nB. Cη contains all chambers of the building X. \n**C. Cη is a finite set of chambers.**\nD. Cη is empty.\n\n**Answer: C** \n"}
