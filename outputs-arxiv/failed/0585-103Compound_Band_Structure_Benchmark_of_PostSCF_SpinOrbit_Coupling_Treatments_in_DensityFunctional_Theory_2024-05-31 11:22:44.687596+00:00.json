Non-relativistic and relativistic radial functions are nearly identical for all orbitals.\nB. Scalar-relativistic ZORA always places the maximum of the radial function closer to the nucleus than the Dirac solution.\nC. The small component of relativistic orbitals is always negligible for total energy differences.\n**D. The j=1/2 component of the relativistic p orbital has a finite probability density at the nucleus, unlike its scalar-relativistic counterpart.**\n\n## Figure 3 Quiz:\n\n**What trend does Figure 3 illustrate regarding different computational approaches to SOC for valence (Cd 4d, Hg 5d) and semi-core (Hg 5p) orbitals?**\n\nA. All methods, including non-relativistic, provide nearly identical results for both valence and semi-core orbitals.\n**B. While all SOC approaches agree well for valence orbitals, noticeable differences appear for semi-core orbitals, with deviations increasing with the strength of the relativistic effect.**\nC. The NAO n.s.c. SOC method consistently overestimates spin-orbit splittings compared to APW-based methods.\nD. The dftatom Dirac solver significantly underestimates spin-orbit splittings compared to all other methods. \n\n## Figure 4 Quiz:\n\n**Figures 4a and 4c compare NAO and (L)APW+lo band structures for GaAs with and without SOC. What can be concluded from these figures?**\n\nA. NAO basis sets are unsuitable for describing the band structure of GaAs due to their limited size.\nB. SOC effects are negligible for GaAs, resulting in nearly identical band structures with and without SOC.\n**C. Both basis sets capture the qualitative features of the GaAs band structure well, including the SOC-induced reduction of the fundamental band gap.**\nD. The NAO n.s.c. SOC method fails to reproduce the characteristic splitting of the valence band maximum at the Γ point.\n\n## Figure 5 Quiz:\n\n**What general trend does Figure 5 demonstrate regarding the agreement between NAO n.s.c. and APW+p1/2 s.c. SOC band structures as a function of the heaviest element (Zmax) in a material?**\n\nA. Agreement is consistently excellent across the entire periodic table, with no noticeable difference between the methods.\nB. NAO n.s.c. SOC consistently underestimates the strength of SOC effects compared to APW+p1/2 s.c. SOC.\n**C. While agreement is excellent for Zmax ≤ 50, deviations become more prominent for heavier elements, particularly for those containing 6p elements.**\nD. The (L)APW+lo method is inherently unreliable for calculating band structures of materials containing elements heavier than Zmax = 50.\n\n## Figure 6 Quiz:\n\n**Figure 6 compares spin-orbit splittings calculated using different SOC approaches. What significant conclusion can be drawn from Figure 6b?**\n\nA. NAO n.s.c. SOC consistently provides the most accurate spin-orbit splittings compared to the APW-based methods.\nB. Spin-orbit splittings are generally insensitive to the choice of density functional, with PBE and HSE06 yielding almost identical results.\nC. The inclusion of p1/2 local orbitals in the APW+lo method has a negligible effect on calculated spin-orbit splittings.\n**D. While deviations between NAO n.s.c. and APW+p1/2 s.c. SOC increase with Zmax, the relative deviation remains small (within 11% for the heaviest elements), indicating reasonable accuracy of the computationally cheaper NAO n.s.c. approach.** \n"}
