It contains 8 gravitons.\nB. It contains 28 spinors.\nC. It contains 8 gravitini. \nD. It contains 70 gravitons.\n\n**Correct answer:** C\n\n**Explanation:** This question refers to the content of equation (2.5)-(2.9) which describes the content of the N=8 supergravity theory in D=4. \n\n## Question 2\n\n**What is the global symmetry algebra of the N=2, D=4 supergravity theory obtained from the product of two N=2 super Yang-Mills theories?**\n\nA.  su(4,2)\nB.  2su(2,1) \nC.  usp(4,2) \nD.  so(8,4) \n\n**Correct answer:** B \n\n**Explanation:** This question refers to the content of Table 5 \"The magic square of supergravities in D=3\", specifically the entry corresponding to the N=2, D=4 supergravity obtained by \"squaring\" two N=2 super Yang-Mills theories.\n\n## Question 3\n\n**Which statement about normed division algebras (NDAs) is INCORRECT?**\n\nA.  The octonions are the only non-associative NDA. \nB.  The quaternions are commutative.\nC.  There are only four NDAs. \nD.  The complex numbers are associative.\n\n**Correct answer:** B\n\n**Explanation:** This question refers to the properties of NDAs summarized in Table 7, specifically the commutativity row. The quaternions are not commutative.\n\n## Question 4\n\n**What does the vertical axis of the conformal magic pyramid in Figure 3 represent?**\n\nA. Spacetime dimension of the conformal theories.\nB. Number of supersymmetries of the conformal theories.\nC.  Type of multiplet being squared (vector or tensor).\nD. The division algebra over which the conformal theories are formulated. \n\n**Correct answer:** D\n\n**Explanation:** This question refers to the explanation of Figure 3 in the text, which states that each level of the pyramid corresponds to a different division algebra. \n"}
