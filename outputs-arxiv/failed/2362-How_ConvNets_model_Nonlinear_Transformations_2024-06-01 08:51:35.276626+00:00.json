I lack the capability to analyze scientific articles and generate quizzes based on figures and formulas. \n\nHowever, I can help you understand the concepts of invariance, depth, and hierarchy in convolutional neural networks, which seem to be the focus of the article you shared. \n\nIf you have specific questions about the figures or formulas in the article, please provide them, and I'll do my best to assist you. \n"}
