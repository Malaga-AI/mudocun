Which section focuses on arguments for the Large Number Hypothesis (LNH) that go beyond simple numerology?\n\n**(A) I. Introduction – Dirac, Zel'dovich and the Large Number Hypothesis **\n**(B) II. Beyond numerology – physical arguments for the LNH**\n**(C) III. Implications of a connection between “dark” and “light” physics**\n**(D) IV. Discussion**\n\n**Correct Answer: (B)**\n\n**Formula 1:  ru/re ~ e²/Gmemp ~ 10^39**\n\n**Question 2:** This formula, presented by Dirac in 1937, relates the radius of the universe (ru) to the classical electron radius (re) and compares it to the ratio of electromagnetic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton. What fundamental assumption did Dirac make when formulating this relation?\n\n**(A) The existence of dark matter.**\n**(B) The non-existence of the cosmological constant (Λ = 0).**\n**(C) The time-independence of the gravitational constant (G).**\n**(D) The equivalence of electron and proton masses.**\n\n**Correct Answer: (B)**\n\n**Formula 2: Λ ~ mG²/ħ⁴**\n\n**Question 3:**  Zel'dovich proposed this formula, suggesting a connection between the cosmological constant (Λ), a mass scale (m), the gravitational constant (G), and Planck's constant (ħ).  What key difference did Zel'dovich introduce compared to Dirac's original assumptions?\n\n**(A) He assumed a time-dependent gravitational constant (G).**\n**(B) He incorporated the Planck mass (mp) as the relevant mass scale.**\n**(C) He considered a small but nonzero cosmological constant (Λ > 0).**\n**(D) He included the electron mass (me) in the relation.**\n\n**Correct Answer: (C)**\n\n**Formula 3:  Λ ~ mG²/αeħ⁴** \n\n**Question 4:** This formula presents a modified relationship between the cosmological constant (Λ) and other fundamental constants, with the inclusion of the fine structure constant (αe). What significant shift in perspective does this modification represent compared to earlier formulations? \n\n**(A) It incorporates aspects of both quantum mechanics and general relativity.**\n**(B) It moves beyond numerology and establishes a link to empirical science.**\n**(C) It introduces a dependence on the mass of the electron neutrino.**\n**(D) It predicts the existence of a minimum density for stable compact objects.**\n\n**Correct Answer: (B)** \n"}
