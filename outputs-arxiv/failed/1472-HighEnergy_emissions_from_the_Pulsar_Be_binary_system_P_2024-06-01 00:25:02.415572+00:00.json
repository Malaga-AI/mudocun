What do the boxes marked INFC and SUPC represent?\n\n**A.**  Points where the pulsar and B star are closest and furthest apart, respectively.\n**B.**  Points of inferior and superior conjunction, respectively, indicating the pulsar's position relative to the observer on Earth.\n**C.**  Regions where the pulsar wind interacts with the Be wind and Be disk, respectively.\n**D.**  The beginning and end of the periastron passage.\n\n**Correct Answer:** **B**\n\n## Figure 2 Quiz\n\n**Question:** This figure depicts the interaction of the pulsar wind with the Be wind/disk. What are the primary emission processes responsible for X-rays and TeV gamma-rays, respectively?\n\n**A.**  Inverse-Compton scattering (ICS) for X-rays and synchrotron radiation for TeV gamma-rays.\n**B.**  Synchrotron radiation for X-rays and ICS for TeV gamma-rays.\n**C.**  Bremsstrahlung radiation for X-rays and curvature radiation for TeV gamma-rays.\n**D.**  Both X-rays and TeV gamma-rays are produced by synchrotron radiation.\n\n**Correct Answer:** **B**\n\n## Figure 3 Quiz\n\n**Question:** This figure presents the long-term Swift/XRT flux evolution of PSR J2032+4127. What trend is clearly observed in the X-ray flux in 2016 (shown in the inset)?\n\n**A.**  A gradual decrease in X-ray flux.\n**B.**  A significant increase in X-ray flux.\n**C.**  Periodic fluctuations in X-ray flux.\n**D.**  No significant change in X-ray flux.\n\n**Correct Answer:** **B**\n\n## Figure 5 Quiz\n\n**Question:** This figure shows the separation between the pulsar and B star (left panel) and the magnetic field strength at the shock apex (right panel) along the orbit. What is the main reason for the large variation in separation and magnetic field strength observed?\n\n**A.**  The system's highly elongated orbit with high eccentricity.\n**B.**  The rapid rotation of the pulsar.\n**C.**  The strong stellar wind from the B star.\n**D.**  The interaction of the pulsar wind with the Be disk.\n\n**Correct Answer:** **A** \n"}
