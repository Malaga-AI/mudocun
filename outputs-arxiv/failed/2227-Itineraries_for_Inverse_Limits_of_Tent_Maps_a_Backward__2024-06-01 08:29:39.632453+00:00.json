The article mainly uses text to describe lemmas, theorems, and their proofs related to the symbolic dynamics of tent maps. \n\nHowever, the article does contain conceptual elements that could be used to construct multiple-choice questions.  \n\nFor example, using the information from \"Section 3.2. Backward Admissibility\" and \"Theorem 17\", you could create a question like:\n\n**Question:**\n\nFor a tent map *f* of rational interior type with  q(κ(*f*)) = q ∈ Q, what is the greatest element *s* ∈ {0,1}^N such that there exists S ∈ J<sub>*f*</sub> with S<sup>←</sup> = *s*? \n\na) *s* = lhe(q)\nb) *s* = rhe(q)\nc) *s* = κ(*f*)\nd)  No such greatest element exists. \n\n**Correct Answer:** b) *s* = rhe(q)\n\n\nThis question tests the understanding of key concepts like rational interior type, kneading sequence (κ(*f*)), and the relationship between backward itineraries (S<sup>←</sup>) and elements of J<sub>*f*</sub>. \n\nYou can formulate similar questions based on other lemmas, theorems, or definitions provided in the article. Remember to focus on the conceptual understanding and key takeaways from the text. \n"}
