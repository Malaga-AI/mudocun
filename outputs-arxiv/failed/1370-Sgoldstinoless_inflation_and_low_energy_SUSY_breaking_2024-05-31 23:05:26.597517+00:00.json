What causes the shrinking of the allowed region with increasing gluino mass?\n\n**A.** The strengthening of the BBN constraint on the Bino decay time.\n**B.** The increasing tension between avoiding tachyons and satisfying the sgoldstino VEV constraint.\n**C.** The increasing gravitino abundance due to inflaton and Bino decay, exceeding the dark matter abundance.\n**D.** The increasing contribution of the freeze-in mechanism to the gravitino abundance.\n\n**Correct Answer: C**\n\n## Figure 3: Dependence of Reheating Temperature on Observables\n\n**Question:** This figure shows the dependence of the spectral tilt (n<sub>s</sub>), number of e-folds (N), and inflaton mass (m<sub>f</sub>) on the reheating temperature (T<sub>re</sub>) for different values of α. What is the key observation about the reheating temperature in the scenario with α = 1/3 (black line)?\n\n**A.** The reheating temperature is always above 10<sup>4</sup> GeV.\n**B.** The reheating temperature is very sensitive to small changes in the number of e-folds.\n**C.** The reheating temperature is independent of the inflaton mass.\n**D.** The reheating temperature is always below 10<sup>2</sup> GeV.\n\n**Correct Answer: B**\n\n## Figure 4: Phenomenological Constraints on Parameter Space\n\n**Question:** This figure displays the phenomenological constraints on the parameter space in the {m<sub>3/2</sub>, m<sub>λ</sub>} plane. What is the primary reason for the upper bounds on both the gluino mass (m<sub>λ</sub>) and the gravitino mass (m<sub>3/2</sub>) in the allowed (white) region?\n\n**A.** The BBN constraint on the Bino decay time.\n**B.** The LHC bound on the gluino mass.\n**C.** The combination of constraints from gravitino overabundance and BBN.\n**D.** The constraint on the sgoldstino VEV along the inflationary trajectory.\n\n**Correct Answer: C** \n"}
