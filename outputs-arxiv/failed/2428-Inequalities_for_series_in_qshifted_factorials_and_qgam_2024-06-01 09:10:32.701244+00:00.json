What does this imply about the function  μ → f(q^μ;x)?\n\nA. It is logarithmically convex on [0,∞). \nB. It is strictly increasing on [0,∞).\nC. It has a local maximum at x=0.\nD. **It is logarithmically concave on [0,∞).** \n\n**Question 2:** Lemma 8 provides a formula for Sm(μ, β). Corollary 8.1 then states that Sm(μ, β) ≥ 0 for specific values of m, μ, and β. Under what condition is this inequality strict?\n\nA. β < 0\nB. **β = 0**\nC. μ = 0\nD. m = 0\n\n**Question 3:**  Lemma 9 offers a condition (formula (21)) for the monotonicity of the rational function Rr,s(x) defined in (20). If this condition is satisfied with specific values for ak and bk, what can we say about the function f(a; x) defined in Example 6?\n\nA.  It satisfies Theorem 4 and its corollaries.\nB.  **It satisfies Theorem 1 and its corollaries.**\nC. It is always a constant function.\nD. It has no real-world applications.\n\n**Question 4:** Example 1 discusses the q-analogues of the modified Bessel function. What key property of the sequences  gn(1)  and  gn(2) allows the application of Theorem 3 and its corollaries to these functions?\n\nA. They are both strictly increasing.\nB. **They are both doubly positive.**\nC. They are both completely monotonic.\nD. They are both logarithmically convex. \n"}
