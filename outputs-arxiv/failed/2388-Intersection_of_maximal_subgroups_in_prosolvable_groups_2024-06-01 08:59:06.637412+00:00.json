The number of subgroups with non-zero Möbius function and the number of intersections of maximal subgroups grow at the same rate.\nB. The number of subgroups with non-zero Möbius function grows faster than the number of intersections of maximal subgroups.\n**C. The number of intersections of maximal subgroups can be significantly larger than the number of subgroups with non-zero Möbius function.**\nD. The limit does not provide meaningful information about the growth of subgroups in G. \n\n**Correct Answer:** C. The number of intersections of maximal subgroups can be significantly larger than the number of subgroups with non-zero Möbius function.\n"}
