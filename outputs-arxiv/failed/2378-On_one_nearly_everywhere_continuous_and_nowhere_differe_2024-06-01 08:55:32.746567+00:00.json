Thus, *Δ* signifies the ternary point and *αi* represents the ternary digits.\n\n**Question 4:**\n\nWhat does the function *φ(i)*  represent in the formula?\n\n**(A)** A constant function equal to 3 for all inputs.\n**(B)** A linear function of the input *i*.\n**(C)** A periodic function with period 3.\n**(D)** A function that maps each ternary digit to a specific ternary digit.\n\n**Correct Answer: (D)**\n\n**Explanation:** Although not explicitly stated here, the subsequent text on page 2 defines *φ(i)* as *3i² + 7i* for *i* belonging to the set {0,1,2}. This shows that *φ(i)* maps each ternary digit (0, 1, or 2) to a specific output, which is also a ternary digit.\n"}
