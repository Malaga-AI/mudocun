What is the median size of these gaps?\n\na) 1.6 meters\nb) 6.6 meters\nc) 16.8 meters \nd) 79.5 meters\n\n**Correct Answer:** b) 6.6 meters \n\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n**Figure 2** (Left) illustrates the distribution of gap sizes using a logarithmic scale. What does this figure tell us about the frequency of different gap sizes?\n\na) Most gaps are extremely large, spanning thousands of data points.\nb)  Gap sizes are evenly distributed, with similar numbers of small and large gaps.\nc)  The majority of gaps are relatively small, while very large gaps are less common.\nd)  It is impossible to determine the frequency of gap sizes from this figure.\n\n**Correct Answer:**  c)  The majority of gaps are relatively small, while very large gaps are less common. \n\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n**Figure 3** compares the performance of different algorithms for predicting missing gap values. Which algorithm generally performs better as the gap size increases?\n\na) OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)\nb) BRR (Bayesian Ridge Regression)\nc) ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)\nd)  All algorithms perform equally well regardless of gap size.\n\n**Correct Answer:** c) ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)\n\n\n**Question 4:**\n\nBased on the text and **Figure 4**, what can we conclude about the relationship between gap size, prediction accuracy, and the visual difference between predicted and actual values?\n\na) Smaller gaps are easier to predict accurately, and the visual difference between predictions and actual values is less noticeable. \nb) Larger gaps are easier to predict accurately, and the visual difference between predictions and actual values is more pronounced.\nc)  Gap size does not impact prediction accuracy or the visual difference between predictions and actual values.\nd)  Only ANNs are capable of accurately predicting missing values, regardless of gap size.\n\n**Correct Answer:** a) Smaller gaps are easier to predict accurately, and the visual difference between predictions and actual values is less noticeable. \n"}
