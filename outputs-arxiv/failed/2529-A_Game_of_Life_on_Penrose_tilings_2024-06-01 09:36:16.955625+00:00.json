The intersections of all lines in the pentagrid.\nB. Tiles of a specific type determined by the chosen vectors.\nC. The starting configuration for a Game of Life simulation.\nD. Tiles with more than four sides, indicating a singular tiling.\n\n**Correct answer: B. Tiles of a specific type determined by the chosen vectors.** \n\n## Figure 2 Quiz:\n\n**What Game Variant is being depicted in this figure?**\n\nA. Variant (i): Game of Life played only on (i, j)-type tiles, others are \"dead\".\nB. Variant (ii): Game of Life played on (i, j)-type tiles, other types associated and reflect the state of their associated dominant tile.\nC. Variant (iii): Simultaneous, non-interacting copies of the Game of Life on each tile type.\nD. Variant (iv): Interacting copies of the Game of Life on each tile type in a singular tiling.\n\n**Correct answer: B.
