Instead, the questions will be based on key formulas and definitions. \n\n**Question 1:** The Kobayashi pseudometric on a complex manifold M is defined as:\n\nA.  d_m(x,y) = inf {sum of Poincaré distances on connecting disks}\nB.  d_m(x,y) = sup {d(x,y) | d is a distance-decreasing holomorphic map from the Poincaré disk to M}\nC.  d_m(x,y) = inf {d(x,y) | d is a distance-decreasing holomorphic map from the Poincaré disk to M}\nD. d_m(x,y) = sup {sum of Poincaré distances on connecting disks} \n\n**Correct Answer:**  C. d_m(x,y) = inf {d(x,y) | d is a distance-decreasing holomorphic map from the Poincaré disk to M}\n\n**Question 2:**  A projective manifold M is considered algebraically hyperbolic if:\n\nA. It does not contain any elliptic or rational curves.\nB. There exists A > 0 such that for any curve C ⊂ M of genus g, deg C < A(g-1).\nC. The Kobayashi pseudometric on M is non-degenerate.\nD. There are no non-constant holomorphic maps from C to M.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B. There exists A > 0 such that for any curve C ⊂ M of genus g, deg C < A(g-1).\n\n**Question 3:**  Consider the formula from Theorem 2.13:\n\n∫_C c_1(T*C) = 2π(2g-2)\n\nWhat does this formula represent in the context of proving that Kobayashi hyperbolicity implies algebraic hyperbolicity?\n\nA. It relates the degree of a curve C to its genus g using the Fubini-Study metric.\nB. It defines the Kobayashi pseudometric on a curve C.\nC. It calculates the volume of a curve C with respect to the Poincaré metric.\nD. It demonstrates that algebraically hyperbolic manifolds cannot contain elliptic curves.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C. It calculates the volume of a curve C with respect to the Poincaré metric.\n\n**Question 4:**  The article uses the following formula in Proposition 3.1:\n\ndeg_w f_i(C) = ∫_M w ∧ (f_i(w)^(n-1)) = ∫_M f_i*(w) ∧ w^(n-1).\n\nWhat is the purpose of this formula in the proof?\n\nA. To show that the image of Aut(M) in GL(H^(1,1)(M,R)) preserves a rational Kähler class.\nB. To demonstrate that the genus of the curve f_i(C) remains constant.\nC. To derive a contradiction from the assumption that M is algebraically hyperbolic while having an infinite Aut(M)-orbit of a rational Kähler class.\nD. To define the action of the infinite subgroup Γ ⊂ Aut(M) on the Picard group Pic(M).\n\n**Correct Answer:**  C. To derive a contradiction from the assumption that M is algebraically hyperbolic while having an infinite Aut(M)-orbit of a rational Kähler class. \n"}
