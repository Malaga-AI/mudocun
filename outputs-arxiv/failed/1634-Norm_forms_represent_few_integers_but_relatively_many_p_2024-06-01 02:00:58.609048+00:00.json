For example, you could ask:\n\n* \"What does the symbol N_{K/Q} represent in formula (x1,...,xa)  ↦  N_{K/Q}(x1w1 + ... + xdwa)?\"\n* \"Referring to the formula  POL = B₁^e₁ ... B_r^e_r, what do the terms 'e_i' and 'f_i' represent?\"\n\nPlease specify the figure or formula you'd like a question about, and I'll be happy to help! \n"}
