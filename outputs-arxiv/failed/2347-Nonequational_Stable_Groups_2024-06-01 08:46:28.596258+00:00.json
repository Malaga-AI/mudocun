Given the equal lengths of the side paths, x is positioned exactly at the midpoint of [pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*), v<sup>4</sup>.pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*)].\n\n---\n\n**Figure 2: The hyperbolic case when |Ax(u) ∩ Ax(v)| > min{tr(u<sup>5</sup>), tr(v<sup>4</sup>)}.**\n\n**Question:** What does this figure illustrate about the intersection of the axes of u and v in this specific case?\n\n**A.** The intersection is empty.\n**B.** The intersection consists of a single vertex. \n**C.** The intersection strictly contains the geodesic segment [pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*), v<sup>4</sup>.pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*)].\n**D.** The intersection is strictly contained within the geodesic segment [pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*), v<sup>4</sup>.pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*)].\n\n**Correct Answer:** C. \n\n**Explanation:** The figure depicts the case where |Ax(u) ∩ Ax(v)| > min{tr(u<sup>5</sup>), tr(v<sup>4</sup>)}. As a result, the intersection of the axes must fully encompass the geodesic segment [pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*), v<sup>4</sup>.pr<sub>Ax(v)</sub>(*)], leading to the contradiction that [u, v] = 1.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 3: The hyperbolic case when |Ax(u)∩Ax(v)| = min{tr(u<sup>5</sup>), tr(v<sup>4</sup>)} and tr(v<sup>4</sup>) ≤ tr(u<sup>5</sup>).**\n\n**Question:** What is the significance of the position of u.v<sup>4</sup>.* in this scenario?\n\n**A.** It lies outside the axis of u.\n**B.**  It coincides with the vertex stabilized by Fw. \n**C.**  It lies within the intersection of the axes, leading to a contradiction. \n**D.** It determines the translation length of u<sup>5</sup>v<sup>4</sup>.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C.\n\n**Explanation:** The text explains that if u.v<sup>4</sup>.* falls within the intersection of the axes,  [u, v] would fix an edge within this intersection. This contradicts the initial assumption that [u, v] ≠ 1, making option C the correct answer. \n\n---\n\n**Figure 4: The hyperbolic case when |Ax(u)∩Ax(v)| = min{tr(u<sup>5</sup>), tr(v<sup>4</sup>)} and tr(u<sup>5</sup>) < tr(v<sup>4</sup>).**\n\n**Question:** What key property does this figure highlight about the action of v<sup>−2</sup>.u<sup>−5</sup>.v<sup>−2</sup>.u<sup>−5</sup>?\n\n**A.** It acts as a reflection through the midpoint of [pr<sub>Ax(u)</sub>(v<sup>4</sup>.*), u<sup>5</sup>.pr<sub>Ax(u)</sub>(v<sup>4</sup>.*)]. \n**B.** It fixes the first edge of the segment [v.*, r].\n**C.** It fixes the vertex stabilized by Fw.\n**D.** It translates points along the axis of v.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B. \n\n**Explanation:** The figure and accompanying text demonstrate that in this case, v<sup>−2</sup>.u<sup>−5</sup>.v<sup>−2</sup>.u<sup>−5</sup> fixes the first edge of the segment [v.*, r]. This observation ultimately contributes to proving (v<sup>−2</sup>u<sup>−5</sup>)<sup>2</sup> to be trivial, leading to a contradiction and further solidifying the overall proof. \n"}
