Please choose the best answer for each question. \n\n**Question 1:**  The paper defines a fragmentation of a Boolean algebra B as a sequence of subsets C1 ⊆ C2 ⊆ ... ⊆ Cn ⊆ ...  Which of the following is NOT a property of this fragmentation?\n\n**a)**  ⋃n Cn = B+ \n**b)** For every n, if a ∈ Cn and a ≤ b then b ∈ Cn.\n**c)** The sequence {Cn} must be finite.\n**d)**  The fragmentation is called σ-bounded cc if for every n there is a constant Kn such that every antichain A ⊆ Cn has size < Kn.\n\n**Correct Answer: c)** The sequence {Cn} must be finite.\n\n**Explanation:** The paper defines the fragmentation as an infinite sequence, not a finite one. \n\n---\n\n**Question 2:**  The paper defines an M-ideal, I, as a set of infinite sequences in B+.  Which of the following is NOT a property of an M-ideal?\n\n**a)** If {an}n ∈ I then ∧nan = 0\n**b)** If s ∈ I and if t is an infinite subsequence of s then t ∈ I\n**c)** If {an}n ∈ I for every k, then {a1, a2, a3…} ∈ I\n**d)**  If {an}n ∈ I and {bn}n ∈ I then {an ∩ bn}n ∈ I\n\n**Correct Answer: d)**  If {an}n ∈ I and {bn}n ∈ I then {an ∩ bn}n ∈ I\n\n**Explanation:**  The actual property (M4) states that {an U bn}n has an infinite subsequence that is in I, not the intersection.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:**  John Kelley proved a theorem about the relationship between σ-additive measures and finitely additive measures on a Boolean σ-algebra B. Which of the following correctly states this relationship?\n\n**a)** B carries a σ-additive measure if and only if it is weakly distributive.\n**b)** B carries a σ-additive measure if and only if it carries a finitely additive measure. \n**c)** B carries a σ-additive measure if and only if it is weakly distributive and carries a finitely additive measure.\n**d)** There is no known relationship between σ-additive and finitely additive measures on a Boolean σ-algebra.\n\n**Correct Answer: c)** B carries a σ-additive measure if and only if it is weakly distributive and carries a finitely additive measure.\n\n**Explanation:** This is the exact statement of Kelley's theorem as presented in the article.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** The article defines the intersection number, κ, of a subset C of B+.  Which of the following statements about κ is FALSE? \n\n**a)** κ is the infimum of ks over all finite sequences s in C.\n**b)** ks = k/n where k is the largest size of a subset J ⊆ {1, ..., n} such that ⋂i∈J ci is nonempty.\n**c)** The sequences s used to calculate κ must be nonrepeating.\n**d)**  If s is a sequence of length n,  repeating each term of s t-times to create a longer sequence s* will result in  κs* = κs.\n\n**Correct Answer: c)** The sequences s used to calculate κ must be nonrepeating.\n\n**Explanation:** The article explicitly states that the sequences s used to calculate κ \"do not have to be nonrepeating.\"\n"}
