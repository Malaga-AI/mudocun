The reflectivities of the outer mirrors are designed to be lower than the inner mirrors for both cavities.\nB. The classical drive for adiabatic passage transfer involves turning on the drive in cavity A before cavity B. \nC. Both wave packet shaping and adiabatic passage utilize a time-dependent classical drive on the matter qubits.\nD. The waveguide in this figure represents a superconducting circuit.\n\n**Correct Answer: C**\n\n## Figure 2 Multiple Choice Quiz\n\n**What does Figure 2 depict?**\n\nA. The energy level diagram of the emitters only, neglecting the cavity and waveguide modes.\nB. A quantum network where two identical cavities are coupled via a waveguide, with each cavity containing a qubit.\nC. A simplified model of cavity losses, omitting fiber and atomic decay.\nD. The time-dependent coupling strengths for wave packet shaping and adiabatic passage protocols.\n\n**Correct Answer: B**\n\n## Figure 3 Multiple Choice Quiz\n\n**Figure 3 illustrates cavity and fiber properties. What does it demonstrate?**\n\nA. The cavity linewidth is always larger than the free spectral range of the fiber, regardless of the regime.\nB. The single mode limit is characterized by a cavity linewidth much smaller than the free spectral range of the waveguide.\nC. Even and odd fiber modes have the same number of maxima in the intensity profile.\nD. The cavity effectively couples to all fiber modes with equal strength in both the multimode and single mode regimes.\n\n**Correct Answer: B**\n\n## Figure 5 Multiple Choice Quiz\n\n**Figure 5 shows an analogy of the energy level scheme for adiabatic passage state transfer. Which statement is INCORRECT?**\n\nA. In both figures, the cavities have been eliminated, leading to an effectively coupled atom-fiber-atom description.\nB. Figure 5a depicts a more complete model by including the first pair of far-detuned fiber modes.\nC. Figure 5b illustrates the simplified model where atoms only couple to a single, resonant fiber mode.\nD. The alternating sign of coupling in the full model allows for a dark state with respect to the whole manifold of excited states.\n\n**Correct Answer: D** \n"}
