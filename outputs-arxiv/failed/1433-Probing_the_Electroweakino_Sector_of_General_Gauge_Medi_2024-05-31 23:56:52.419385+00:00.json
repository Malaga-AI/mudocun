Therefore, I can't create specific multiple-choice questions based on figures or formulas in the article. \n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to create multiple-choice quizzes about figures or formulas in scientific articles.\n\n**Creating Effective Multiple-Choice Questions**\n\nHere are the general steps and tips:\n\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\n   - What are the most important concepts conveyed by the figure or formula?\n   - What conclusions can be drawn from the data presented?\n\n2. **Formulate a Clear Question Stem:**\n   - The question stem should be concise and focused on a single concept.\n   - Use appropriate scientific terminology. \n\n3. **Develop Plausible Answer Choices:**\n   - **The correct answer:** Should be accurate and unambiguous.\n   - **Distractors (incorrect answers):** \n      - Should be plausible and related to the topic.\n      - Avoid \"all of the above\" or \"none of the above\" choices.\n      - Make sure distractors are grammatically consistent with the stem.\n\n4. **Review for Clarity and Accuracy:**\n   - Ensure the question is clear and easily understood.\n   - Double-check the accuracy of the information in both the stem and answers.\n\n**Examples of Question Types Based on Figures/Formulas**\n\n* **Data Interpretation:**  \"According to Figure 3, what is the relationship between variable X and variable Y?\"\n* **Calculation:** \"Using the formula provided in Equation 2, calculate the value of Z when X = 5 and Y = 10.\"\n* **Concept Application:** \"The trend shown in Figure 1 is best explained by which of the following principles?\"\n* **Experimental Design:** \"Which of the following modifications to the experimental setup (Figure 2) would be most likely to test the hypothesis?\"\n\n**Remember:**  The best multiple-choice questions assess understanding and application of knowledge, not just rote memorization. \n"}
