When considering Pascal's Triangle modulo a composite number, this theorem explains why the resulting pattern is a union of the patterns obtained from its prime factors, each with potentially different visual representations.\n\n\n## Figure 3: Constructing the Sierpinski Triangle\n\n**Question:** What transformation, when applied repeatedly to a shape, results in the Sierpinski triangle fractal as shown in the figure?\n\nA) Rotation by 60 degrees and scaling by a factor of 1/2.\nB) Reflection across the y-axis and scaling by a factor of 1/2.\nC) Shrinking by a factor of 1/2 and creating three copies arranged in a triangle. \nD) Shrinking by a factor of 1/3 and creating four copies arranged in a square. \n\n**Correct Answer:** C) Shrinking by a factor of 1/2 and creating three copies arranged in a triangle. \n\n**Explanation:** The Sierpinski triangle is constructed by repeatedly shrinking a shape to half its size and arranging three copies of the shrunk shape in the corners of an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n## Figure 4: Pascal's Triangle Modulo 2 and the Sierpinski Triangle\n\n**Question:**  In Figure 4, what does the region labeled 'Pn+1' represent?\n\nA) The first 2<sup>n</sup> rows of Pascal's Triangle modulo 2.\nB) The first 2<sup>n+1</sup> rows of Pascal's Triangle modulo 2.\nC) The first 2<sup>n</sup> rows of Pascal's Triangle. \nD) The complete Sierpinski triangle.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The first 2<sup>n+1</sup> rows of Pascal's Triangle modulo 2.\n\n**Explanation:**  Figure 4 illustrates how the Sierpinski triangle emerges from Pascal's Triangle modulo 2. P<sub>n+1</sub> represents the larger triangle formed by the first 2<sup>n+1</sup> rows, which contains three copies of P<sub>n</sub>, the triangle formed by the first 2<sup>n</sup> rows. \n\n\n## Figure 6: p-adic Valuation in Pascal's Triangle Modulo p<sup>k</sup>\n\n**Question:** In the context of Figure 6, what does the p-adic valuation Î½<sub>p</sub>(n) of a number n signify?\n\nA) The number of digits of n when expressed in base p.\nB) The largest integer k such that p<sup>k</sup> is less than or equal to n.\nC) The remainder when n is divided by p. \nD) The largest power of p that divides n.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) The largest power of p that divides n.\n\n**Explanation:** The p-adic valuation provides information about the divisibility of a number by powers of a prime p.  A higher p-adic valuation indicates that a number is divisible by a larger power of p. This concept is crucial in understanding the patterns within Pascal's Triangle modulo powers of a prime. \n"}
