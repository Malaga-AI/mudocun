What is the main difference between the primary and secondary scintillation seeding mechanisms depicted?","choices":["Primary scintillation involves lower energy electrons than secondary scintillation.","Secondary scintillation predominantly populates specific low-lying excited states, while primary scintillation shows a broader distribution across all states.","Primary scintillation is more efficient at exciting higher-lying states compared to secondary scintillation.","Secondary scintillation only occurs in the presence of molecular additives."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 2 shows the simulated time and wavelength distributions for primary and secondary scintillation in pure xenon. What does the upper plot (time distribution) indicate about the relationship between pressure and scintillation decay time?","choices":["The scintillation decay time is independent of pressure.","Higher pressure leads to a faster scintillation decay time.","Lower pressure leads to a faster scintillation decay time.","Pressure only affects the wavelength distribution, not the time distribution."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 3 presents the drift velocity (vd) and longitudinal charge spread (σz) for Xe-CF4 mixtures.
