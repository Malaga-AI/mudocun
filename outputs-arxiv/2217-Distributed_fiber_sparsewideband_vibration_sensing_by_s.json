What can be concluded from these results?","choices":["Increasing the maximum sampling interval factor (kt) always improves the SNR.","The AWG sampling rate (fs-awg) has negligible impact on the frequency aliasing effect.","A higher sampling length (N) and a larger analytical frequency resolution factor (ka) generally lead to a better SNR, indicating improved signal reconstruction.","The optimal sampling parameters are independent of the specific application and signal characteristics."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 3 compares Nyquist Uniform Sampling (NUS) and Sub-Nyquist Additive Random Sampling (SNARS) in a φ-OTDR system.
