Which statement about this limit is **correct**?","choices":["The distance between the supertubes, 2|L|, is much larger than their average radius, R.","The supertubes merge into a single entity with combined monodromy.","This limit simplifies the problem by allowing analysis in near and far regions.","The monodromy matrices of the supertubes become Abelian in this limit."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 3 shows the monodromy structure in the near region of the two supertubes. What does the singularity at z = âˆž represent in the context of supertubes?","choices":["It signifies the infinite extent of the supertubes.","It represents the asymptotic freedom of the underlying gauge theory.","It is an artifact of the near-region approximation and has no physical meaning.","It indicates a region where the supertubes annihilate each other."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Equation (1.5) expresses the harmonic solution for the non-Abelian supertubes in terms of complex functions F and G.
