Which statement best describes the relationship between these two parameters?","choices":["η and τd are unrelated and determined by independent physical processes.","τd is adjusted to maintain a constant radial pebble mass flux despite changes in η.","η is directly proportional to τd, leading to similar trends in their radial profiles.","η and τd are both influenced by the presence of embedded embryos."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure displays a migration map showing the total torque on an embryo (γΓtot/Γ0) as a function of its mass (Mem) and radial distance (r). What does the blue region in the outer disk signify?","choices":["A region where embryos experience strong inward migration.","A region of convergent migration where embryos are expected to accumulate.","A region where embryos experience no migration due to a balance of torques.","A region where the heating torque dominates, leading to outward migration."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure shows the temporal evolution of the filtering factor (F) for four embryos. What does the filtering factor represent in the context of pebble accretion?","choices":["The fraction of pebbles that are scattered away from the embryo by gas drag.","The efficiency with which the embryo captures pebbles from the surrounding disk.","The ratio of the embryo\\'s accretion rate to the viscous spreading rate of the disk.","The fraction of pebbles that are fragmented due to collisions within the Hill sphere."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}}],"metadata":{"creation_metadata":{"model":"publishers/google/models/gemini-1.5-pro-001","region":"europe-west9","num_input_tokens":6472,"num_output_tokens":591,"generation_time":53.49812197685242,"timestamp":"2024-05-31 11:45:58.790974+00:00"},"structuring_metadata":{"model":"publishers/google/models/gemini-1.5-pro-001","region":"europe-west9","num_input_tokens":700,"num_output_tokens":411,"generation_time":10.35549807548523,"timestamp":"2024-05-31 11:46:09.147978+00:00"}}}
