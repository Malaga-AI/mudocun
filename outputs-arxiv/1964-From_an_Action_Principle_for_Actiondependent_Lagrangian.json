What is the most important consequence of the constant cosmological four-vector λμ on the expansion of the Universe?","choices":["It causes the Universe to collapse for both matter and radiation-dominated eras.","It has negligible impact on the expansion rate for both matter and radiation-dominated eras.","It leads to an accelerated expansion rate for λμ < 0 without the need for dark energy.","It halts the expansion of the Universe at a finite time for both matter and radiation-dominated eras."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Equation (25) presents the generalized gravitational field equation derived in the paper. What is the significance of the term Κμν in this equation?","choices":["It represents the energy-momentum tensor of the matter field.","It describes the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of matter.","It accounts for the non-conservative nature of the gravitational field when λμ ≠ 0.","It represents the cosmological constant, which can vary with spacetime coordinates."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Equation (30) describes the behavior of the gravitational coupling constant G(t) as a function of time in this modified theory of gravity. What happens to the coupling between geometry and matter when  λμ > 0?","choices":["The coupling strengthens with time, leading to a more dominant gravitational interaction.","The coupling remains constant over time, similar to standard general relativity.","The coupling weakens with time, potentially leading to a decoupling of matter and geometry.","The coupling oscillates with time, leading to periodic variations in the strength of gravity."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Equation (26) describes the behavior of gravitational waves in this modified theory of gravity.
