What new phenomenon is observed in the presence of cosolutes, besides the intrinsic volume transition?","choices":["Cosolute-induced swelling, where cosolutes cause the network to swell even in bad solvent conditions.","Cosolute-induced collapse, where strong cosolute attraction to the monomers can collapse the network even in good solvent conditions.","Cosolute-independent collapse, where cosolutes have no impact on the volume transition of the network.","Cosolute-induced dissolution, where high cosolute concentrations lead to the complete dissolution of the network."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure showcases the adsorption energy profile as a function of both solvent quality and cosolute coupling parameters for flexible and semi-flexible networks.
