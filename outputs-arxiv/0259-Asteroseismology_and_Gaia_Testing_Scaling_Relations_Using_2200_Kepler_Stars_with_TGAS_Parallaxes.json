What can be concluded from the overall agreement between these methods?","choices":["Systematic differences between asteroseismic methods for calculating distances are significant.","The direct method for calculating distances is significantly more accurate than grid modeling.","The choice of isochrone grid has a significant impact on the calculated distances.","Systematic differences between asteroseismic methods for calculating distances are generally small."],"correct_answer_idx":3},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 4 compares asteroseismic and TGAS parallaxes. Why is there a diagonal \"edge\" in the ratio plot (bottom panel) towards low parallax values?","choices":["TGAS parallaxes are systematically overestimated compared to asteroseismology for distant stars.","Large TGAS uncertainties for distant stars cause them to scatter to lower values than asteroseismology.","Asteroseismic distances are systematically overestimated for low-mass stars.","TGAS systematically underestimates parallaxes for metal-poor stars."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 8d shows the ratio of TGAS and asteroseismic radii as a function of TGAS radius.
