binder?","choices":["The DSL binder acts as a multiple access channel in both the upstream and downstream.","The DSL binder experiences only FEXT and eliminates NEXT due to the twisted pair structure.","FEXT and NEXT represent the direct path and coupled signals respectively.","The DSL binder acts as a multiple access channel in the upstream and a broadcast channel in the

processing?","choices":["Coordinated signal processing is applied at each CPE to reduce the effect of FEXT.","Signal coordination among CPEs enables joint transmit processing.","Received signals from all users are collected at the DP and processed jointly to reduce FEXT.","Each CPE decodes its signal independently without coordination, treating the binder as an interference channel."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"How does vectored transmit processing differ from vectored receive processing?","choices":["Vectored transmit processing is only applicable in the upstream while vectored receive processing is for the downstream.","Vectored transmit processing involves pre-equalization at the DP to reduce FEXT, while vectored receive processing cancels FEXT at the receiver.","Vectored transmit processing relies on signal coordination among CPEs, while vectored receive processing does not.","Both vectored transmit and receive processing require a dedicated precoder at each CPE to cancel self-crosstalk."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Which factors contribute to FEXT coupling as
