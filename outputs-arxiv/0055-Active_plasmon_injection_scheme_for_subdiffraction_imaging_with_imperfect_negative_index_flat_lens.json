What is the main reason for the poor resolution in the \"Compensated Image\" compared to the three-Gaussian object in Figure 1?","choices":["The four-Gaussian object has a higher spatial frequency content that is more susceptible to noise.","The NIFL used in Figure 3 has a higher degree of material loss.","The passive inverse filter is not powerful enough to compensate for the increased complexity of the object.","The four-Gaussian object is illuminated with a lower intensity, leading to a lower signal-to-noise ratio."],"correct_answer_idx":0},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"In Figure 4, the Fourier spectrum of the four-Gaussian object reveals a feature at ky/k0 = 2 that is buried under noise. What is the main limitation this poses for the passive compensation scheme?","choices":["It prevents accurate determination of the object\\'s spatial frequency content.","It hinders the ability to effectively compensate for material losses at that specific spatial frequency.","It introduces significant distortions in the reconstructed image, making it unrecognizable.","It necessitates the use of complex and computationally expensive algorithms for noise reduction."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 5 illustrates the geometry used for numerical simulations of the NIFL.
