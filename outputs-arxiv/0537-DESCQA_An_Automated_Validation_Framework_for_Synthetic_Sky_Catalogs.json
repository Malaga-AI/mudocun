What adjustment was made to the Li & White (2009) data to ensure consistency with the MBII definition of stellar mass?","choices":["No adjustment was made.","The Li & White (2009) data was shifted to higher masses to account for the mass in stellar remnants.","The Li & White (2009) data was shifted to lower masses to account for the overestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies.","The Li & White (2009) data was scaled to match the simulation box size of the MBII simulation."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"The figure compares stellar mass functions from various synthetic galaxy catalogs to the validation data from Li & White (2009). Which class of synthetic catalog models consistently demonstrates the best agreement with the validation data across the entire mass range considered?","choices":["Semi-Analytic Models (SAG, Galacticus)","Abundance Matching Models (CAM_LiWhite, SHAM_LiWhite, CAM_MBII, SHAM_MBII)","Improved Halo Occupation Distribution Model (iHOD)","Hydrodynamical Simulation (MBII)"],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure compares the halo mass function (HMF) of different synthetic galaxy catalogs with the analytical fit from Tinker et al. (2008).  Why do discrepancies arise between the catalogs at low halo masses (< 10^11 Mâ˜‰)?","choices":["Baryonic effects are not accurately modeled in the catalogs.","Different catalogs include varying abundances of low-mass halos due to differences in their halo occupation function.","The Tinker et al.
