Which statement about the shaded blue areas is CORRECT?","choices":["These areas represent regions where the cosmological constant model is favored.","The shaded areas indicate regions where an effective cosmological constant cannot explain the data.","These areas demonstrate the high probability of finding a unique solution for Ωeff.","The shaded areas illustrate the insignificant impact of different priors on the results."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 2 displays the 1σ–3σ contours of the (Ω*low, Ω*up) posterior probability distribution. What can we conclude from the round corners observed in these contours?","choices":["The bounds Ω*low and Ω*up are independent of each other.","The round corners arise from systematic errors in the data.","The round corners indicate a strong correlation between the lower and upper bounds of Ωeff.","The shape of the contours is purely coincidental and bears no physical significance."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 3 explores the parameter space of log(m) vs. log(D²-1) for the Visser\\'s theory. What trend is evident from this figure?","choices":["As the graviton mass parameter (m) increases, the difference between the dynamical and background metrics also increases.","Higher values of the graviton mass parameter correspond to smaller differences between the dynamical and background metrics.","The graviton mass parameter shows no discernible relationship with the difference between the dynamical and background metrics.","The figure primarily emphasizes the insignificant role of the graviton mass in this model."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Formula (32) expresses the dimensionless density parameter (Ωeff) within the Hassan and Rosen approach.
