for fNL = 1, which is larger than the cosmic variance.","The figure illustrates the potential for sample variance cancellation when comparing the power spectrum of biased (galaxies) and unbiased (CMB lensing) tracers of LSS.","The figure shows that the signal for fNL = 1 is significantly larger than the cosmic variance, making it easily detectable."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"What does Figure 2 illustrate about the impact of massive neutrinos on the power spectra of matter density?","choices":["Massive neutrinos enhance the clustering power on all scales, leading to a scale-independent increase in both auto- and cross-power spectra.","The neutrino free-streaming scale has no significant impact on the relative amplitudes of the total matter density power spectrum and its cross-spectrum with cold-dark-matter-baryon density.","On scales smaller than the neutrino free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the auto-power spectrum of total matter density relative to its cross-spectrum with cold-dark-matter-baryon density.","The figure shows that the suppression of the total matter power spectrum due to neutrinos is independent of redshift."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"What information is conveyed by Figure 3 regarding CMB lensing measurements with a possible CMB-S4 experiment?","choices":["The figure shows that the CMB lensing signal remains subdominant to the noise on all scales.","The minimum-variance combination of lensing estimators is dominated by the temperature-based (TT) reconstruction.","The EB lens reconstruction provides the most significant contribution to the minimum-variance lensing estimator, especially after accounting for the improvement from iterative reconstruction.","The figure indicates that the CMB lensing measurement is noise-dominated for ℓ <

galaxy number densities?","choices":["The figure shows that the galaxy number density peaks at z ~ 4 and drops at lower and higher redshift for both LSST and DESI.","It illustrates the significantly higher number density of spectroscopic DESI galaxies compared to photometric LSST galaxies at all redshifts.","It demonstrates the redshift distribution of tomographic LSST redshift bins and a low-redshift bin from DESI, highlighting their overlap with the CMB lensing kernel.","The figure shows that the CMB lensing kernel has a much narrower redshift distribution than the galaxy samples, peaking around z = 6."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"What insights regarding the correlation coefficient between CMB-S4 lensing measurements and galaxy density can be drawn from Figure 5?","choices":["The correlation coefficient is consistently low (below 50%) for all LSST redshift bins and DESI BGS, regardless of the angular scale.","The correlation coefficient peaks at ℓ ~ 1000 for all LSST redshift bins, indicating the optimal angular scale for exploiting sample variance cancellation.","Combining different LSS tracers into a single joint sample significantly reduces the correlation coefficient compared to individual redshift bins.","The figure shows that a combined LSS sample, weighted to match the CMB lensing kernel, achieves a high correlation coefficient (above 90%) with CMB-S4 lensing measurements on large
