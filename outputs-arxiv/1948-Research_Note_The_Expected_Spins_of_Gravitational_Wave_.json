What can you infer from the steep dependence of  t_merge and t_tr on separation (d)?","choices":["The transition between tidal torques being important (t_tr << t_WR) and unimportant (t_tr >> t_WR) occurs over a large range of separations.","The transition between tidal torques being important and unimportant is highly sensitive to the details of the system.","The location where tidal torques become important (d_tr) is significantly different from the distance needed for the binary to merge in a Hubble time (d_merge).","The transition between tidal torques being important and unimportant occurs over a very small range of separations."],"correct_answer_idx":3},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure shows the spin parameter of a tidally locked WR star (a_sync) as a function of separation. What is the main takeaway from this figure?","choices":["Tidally locked WR stars generally have low angular momentum compared to a maximally rotating BH of the same mass.","The spin parameter of the WR star increases linearly with increasing binary separation.","The mass of the WR star has a negligible effect on its spin parameter at a given separation.","Tidally locked WR stars typically possess angular momentum greater than a maximally rotating BH of equal mass for a wide range of separations."],"correct_answer_idx":3},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure depicts the final spin of a WR star before collapse (a(t_WR, d)) for various binary separations. What does the rapid transition from low to high spin values signify?","choices":["The impact of wind-driven angular momentum loss is negligible compared to tidal effects.","The initial spin of the WR star is the dominant factor determining its final spin.","There exists a critical separation where tidal forces become significantly stronger than wind effects, leading to rapid spin-up of the WR star.","The mass of the BH has a negligible effect on the final spin of the WR star."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"This figure presents the expected distributions of X_eff for merging black holes, assuming negligible birth spins. What is the key feature of these distributions and its implication on the formation of gravitational wave sources?","choices":["The distributions are unimodal, suggesting a single dominant formation channel for binary black holes.","The distributions are bimodal, suggesting two distinct formation channels for binary black holes: one with maximally spinning secondaries and another with slowly spinning secondaries.","The distributions peak at X_eff = 0, implying that most binary black holes are formed with negligible spins.","The shape of the distribution is highly sensitive to the initial mass ratio of the binary."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}}],"metadata":{"creation_metadata":{"model":"publishers/google/models/gemini-1.5-pro-001","region":"europe-west9","num_input_tokens":1312,"num_output_tokens":665,"generation_time":15.384838104248047,"timestamp":"2024-06-01 07:08:31.837071+00:00"},"structuring_metadata":{"model":"publishers/google/models/gemini-1.5-pro-001","region":"europe-west9","num_input_tokens":774,"num_output_tokens":550,"generation_time":13.093819856643677,"timestamp":"2024-06-01 07:08:44.932137+00:00"}}}
