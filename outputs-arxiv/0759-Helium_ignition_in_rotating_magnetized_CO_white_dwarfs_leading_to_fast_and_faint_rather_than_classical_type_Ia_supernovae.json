What trend can be observed regarding the spin-up of white dwarfs with different initial masses?","choices":["Less massive white dwarfs spin up more slowly than more massive ones due to their higher rotational inertia.","The initial luminosity has a stronger effect on the spin-up time than the initial mass of the white dwarf.","Less massive white dwarfs spin up faster than more massive ones due to their lower rotational inertia.","The spin-up time is independent of both the initial luminosity and the initial mass of the white dwarf."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 4 presents the temperature-density profiles of a rotating and a non-rotating WD with 0.54 MâŠ™.
