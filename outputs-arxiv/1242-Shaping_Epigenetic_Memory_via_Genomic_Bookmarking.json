What happens to the established pattern when asymmetric interactions favor the blue mark, and bookmark excision occurs?","choices":["The red domain remains stable despite bookmark excision.","Bookmark excision has no effect on the established epigenetic pattern.","Bookmark excision eventually leads to the loss of the red domain as blue marks take over.","DNA replication, not bookmark excision, destabilizes the epigenetic pattern."],"correct_answer_idx":2},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure S6 validates the model by comparing it to experimental data from Drosophila S2 cells.
