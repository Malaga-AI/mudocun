Which statement accurately reflects the findings presented?","choices":["The soliton\\'s survival probability decays linearly with increasing modulation duration (ta).","Increasing the modulation depth (e) leads to a faster escape of the soliton, indicating a thermally activated process.","The experimental data is inconsistent with Kramers\\' model for overdamped systems.","The extracted barrier height (W) is independent of the effective temperature of the system."],"correct_answer_idx":1},"metadata":{"is_validated":false,"validator":null,"explanation":null}},{"multiple_choice_question":{"text":"Figure 4 focuses on the transport directionality (TD) of the soliton.
